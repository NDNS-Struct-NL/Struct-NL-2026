We are excited to announce **struct NL 2026**: the first edition of a Dutch workshop on structure-preserving numerical methods.
This two-day workshop will bring together researchers from across the Netherlands to share methodologies, foster interdisciplinary collaboration, and strengthen the national research community in this strategically important field.
We aim to connect diverse research lines - including geometric integration, variational discretization, and scientific machine learning - to enhance collective impact and innovation.

This workshop is organized by **struct NL**, the [NDNS+](https://www.ndns.nl/) Special Activity Group on Structure-preserving Numerical Methods.
This is a community dedicated to developing advanced numerical techniques that encode the fundamental physical laws and geometric structures underlying complex systems. Join the **struct NL** mailing list [here](https://listserv.tudelft.nl/mailman/listinfo/ndns-struc-pres-2025).

* **When**: June 18-19, 2026
* **Where**: [Center for Complex System Studies, Utrecht University](map/)
* **What**: See the preliminary program [here](program/)
* **Who**: Confirmed speakers and organizing committee [here](participants/)
* **How**: Instructions for registration and (optional) abstract submission for contributed talks are below


### Acknowledgment

This community is funded by the Dutch [Nonlinear Dynamics of Natural Systems Cluster](https://www.ndns.nl/).

### Registration

Registration for this workshop is **free**, but mandatory. Lunch will be provided by the venue.

### Call for abstracts

In addition to the keynote talks by invited speakers, there will be a possibility to present contributed talks (15 + 5).
If you would like to be considered for one of these talks, please send a maximum **250-word abstract**.
The topic of your presentation should align with the SAG's core theme of **Structure-Preserving Numerical Methods** and can cover areas such as:
* **Geometric Foundations:** Variational, Hamiltonian, or metriplectic formulations of field theories
* **Methodologies:** Geometric integration, finite element exterior calculus, variational discretization, or structure-preserving scientific machine learning
* **Practical Application:** Usage in fields such as fluid dynamics, plasma physics, geophysics, or climate science
* **Implementation & Deployment:** High-quality, open-source, modular software frameworks for structure-preserving methods

We especially encourage submissions that resonate with the SAG's goal of fostering a collaborative community and training the next generation of researchers.

Please also register for the workshop separately.  

### Important dates

* **Abstract submission closes on TBA, 23:59 ([CET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Time)).**
* **Abstract acceptance will be notified on TBA.**
* **Registration closes on TBA, 23:59 ([CET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Time)).**
